Hello there my tangential comerade

Here is a remake of the game snake that I programmed an AI for. The AI is decent, it can make to at least 10 points usually, after that though it starts to scramble a bit. If you want to help out the AI you can use the arround keys, and if you want to remove the AI and just play snake on it's own, I think there's a way to remove the "snake eyes" file from the program/ turn it off before running the game; if you have unity i mean, other wise, im not to sure, sorry. If you want to read what I wrote when I was 18 out of "author intrest," you can take a look at the other read me I made in 2021 out of, although I think it's pretty arogant and not very helpful. I hope you enjoy what I've made for you. 

Thank you for taking a look.
