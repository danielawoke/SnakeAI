# SnakeAI


Dear person

There isnt a reset button since I was too lazy to make one. You'll have to reopen the application entirely.
This AI is far from perfect; the snake will frequently turn into its self, or forget to turn entirely for 
reasons I am completely unsure of. The algorithim for this, however, will now be information for the rest of the world to enjoy.


All the code i did for the snake AI's "brain" is in the "SnakeEyes.cs" file in the assets folder. 

I should mention that you are able to manually move the snake using the arrow keys and increase the length of the snake's body by 
pressing the space bar. I left those testing tools in there out of laziness :)

Most unity gits dont have the library folder included, and this one does not. Just keep that in mind.

-Love, frozennuts
