# SnakeAI


Dear person

There isnt a reset button since I was too lazy to make one. You'll have to reopen the application entirely.
This AI is far from perfect; the snake will frequently turn into its self, or forget to turn entirely for 
reasons I am completely unsure of. The algorithim for this, however, will now be information for the rest of the world to enjoy.

-Love, frozennuts
